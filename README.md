# Creating the TrueLayer Press Page - Product design perspective.

> **Brief:** We would like you to create a new static page for our website called "Press". The page should collect links to all the articles out there that talk about TrueLayer. Your goal is to create a page that "shows" rather than "telling".<br><br>At TrueLayer we love to stay up to date with what is hot in web design and we like our brand to reflect this passion of Ours.

## Problem
Brief analysis definition of the problem.
* TrueLayer want to show their expertise to enhance their visibility.

## Goals
* Enhance connection with clients, partners and entrepreneurs.
* Attracts job seekers. 
* Facilitate the work of journalists to be more featured into press.

## Personas
Following the Goals I identified 4 types of users with specifics needs and pain:
* clients- is Looking for trust through visibility and reputation of TrueLayer brand.
* Job seeker - is Looking for company culture and product articles to help to project himself into the next job he will apply for.
* Media contact - is  looking at any articles to help him to write one. he needs press kit and guide lines to write about TrueLayer.
* Internal - is part of TrueLayer, he comes to have a look on his article and colleagues articles, he needs to quickly find a specific article.

## Proposal
Instead of proposing a Google news feed based on publishing date I split every articles on 3 categories to fix the needs of each personas identified. 
<br><br>
This method, allows user to directly switch into the topic is interested in, and facilitate is journey through the website to help him to find what is looking for quickly.

### 3 categories
* __Press__- All external articles.
* __Insider__- All enterprise culture and story telling articles.
* __Product__- All case study and new release.

For internal user I propose a search bar to search articles titles or authors, and a "sort by" input to sort article into date, authors, or others criteria.

## Prototype
To build the prototype of TrueLayer press page, I used simple interaction flow and focus my intention into micro interaction.

### User journey
The user land into the website and is able to read an article in one click we feature the most recent article to enhance its visibility.

### Immersive landing animation
The top of the page is falling from the top to the bottom it unconsciously indicate to the user the way to read the interface.

### Contextuel illustration
The illustration is representing a book into a laptop it enhance the context of digital magazine. When the user is browsing multiple TrueLayer website it create a semiological language to quickly recognise where  you are.

### Rounded cards
Using border-radius into elements will be perceive by users such as clickable element, in fact, users equate round shape to their finger and want to touch it to trigger somethings. 

### Hover call to action
When the user hover an article 3 elements will be trigger:

* The featured image of the article is elevating to immerse the user into the article.
* The title is underlying.
* An animated arrows appear to enhance the call to action.

All this design artefact allows the user to link every elements of one article and avoid confusion.

### Responsive interface
To maximise the traffic on the page I adapt the design of the interface for all devises.

## Design System
Through my research in existing TrueLayer website I identified a few kink that can be improve especially about accessibility. To keep TrueLayer branding experience entire, I didn't modify it but I think is important to notice it.

### Gradient background
The usage of gradient for large parts of your interface is pretty tricky cause of the accessibility contrast ratio between each side.

### Branding colour $Sun 
The branding colour $sun is hard to use, indeed button $sun and text $sun do not reach the AA grade of the WCAAG. So, it wont be readable for disabled users and it wont be confortable for any users.

### Typography
Through my experience at Societe Generale I've made significant research on typeface and I wanted to share with you the outcome of this research. this is the reason why I made the interface with Inter font:

During a long time designers were using same fonts for print and web but a lot of study described different user behaviour with a physical or digital products. So, the first Google font was initially made to perfectly fit on screen and later in 2015 Apple created the first dynamic font SF pro which is using every Opentype feature but also font feature specifically made for digital usage. Inter and more recently Helvetica now are following this trend and has implemented those feature into there font set.
<br><br>
The most interesting font feature is certainly the Dynamic Metrics.

> There's of course no absolute right or wrong when it comes to expressing yourself with typography, but Inter Dynamic Metrics provides guidelines for how to best use Inter. You simply provide the optical font size, and the tracking and line height is calculated for you.

Today, as far as I know there are 3 fonts which is following this trend:
* SF Pro - Property of Apple Inc can't be used by any one else.
* Helevetica Now - The most used font family you need to pay a licence to use it.
* Inter - Designed by Rasmus Andersson Figma Designer. the font is made for design systems and is Open source.

## Conclusion
I hope you find this study interesting and I hope I will have the opportunity to go deeper in the details during face to face meeting.

# Creating the TrueLayer Press Page - Product design perspective.

> **Brief:** We would like you to create a new static page for our website called "Press". The page should collect links to all the articles out there that talk about TrueLayer. Your goal is to create a page that "shows" rather than "telling".<br><br>At TrueLayer we love to stay up to date with what is hot in web design and we like our brand to reflect this passion of Ours.

## Problem
Brief analysis definition of the problem.
* TrueLayer want to show their expertise to enhance their visibility.

## Goals
* Enhance connection with clients, partners and entrepreneurs.
* Attracts job seekers. 
* Facilitate the work of journalists to be more featured into press.

## Personas
Following the Goals I identified 4 types of users with specifics needs and pain:
• clients- is Looking for trust through visibility and reputation of TrueLayer brand.
• Job seeker - is Looking for company culture and product articles to help to project himself into the next job he will apply for.
• Media contact - is  looking at any articles to help him to write one. he needs press kit and guide lines to write about TrueLayer.
• Internal - is part of TrueLayer, he comes to have a look on his article and colleagues articles, he needs to quickly find a specific article.

## Proposal
Instead of proposing a Google news feed based on publishing date I split every articles on 3 categories to fix the needs of each personas identified. 
<br><br>
This method, allows user to directly switch into the topic is interested in, and facilitate is journey through the website to help him to find what is looking for quickly.

### 3 categories
• __Press__- All external articles.
• __Insider __- All enterprise culture and story telling articles.
• __Product __- All case study and new release.

For internal user I propose a search bar to search articles titles or authors, and a "sort by" input to sort article into date, authors, or others criteria.
